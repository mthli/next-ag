Next Tiny AI Agents Framework 🪩

Based on [Vercel AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/), inspired by the implementation of [pi-agent-core](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/tree/main/packages/agent).

## Package

TODO

## Motivation

There are some reasons that Pi's author Mario Zechner does't build Pi on top of Vercel AI SDK, [read this blog post](https://mariozechner.at/posts/2025-11-30-pi-coding-agent/) if you're interested.

But for someone who wants to implement a tiny agent framework, the Vercel AI SDK is still a good start, as it provides a unified LLM API with multi-provider support, has excellent documentation, and integrates effortlessly with the Vercel ecosystem, such as [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

We can see how far we can push this before running into the same issues Mario Zechner did 🏃
